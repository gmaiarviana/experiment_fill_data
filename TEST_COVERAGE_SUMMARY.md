- Clear documentation of expected system behavior
- Automated validation of new features against user expectations

#### **3. Quality Assurance**
- Systematic testing of Brazilian-specific validation rules
- Context management validation across multiple sessions
- Error handling verification for production reliability

#### **4. Future Maintenance**
- Test infrastructure ready for additional scenarios
- Clear patterns for extending test coverage
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline capabilities

### 🔄 Test Execution Instructions

#### **Run All Integration Tests**
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose exec api python -m pytest tests/integration/test_user_journey_simple.py -v -s
```

#### **Run Validation Tests**
```bash
docker-compose exec api python -m pytest tests/test_unified_validation.py -v
```

#### **Run Health Tests**
```bash
docker-compose exec api python -m pytest tests/test_health.py -v
```

#### **Expected Results**
- **Integration Tests**: 8/8 passing (~81s runtime)
- **Validation Tests**: 12/12 passing (~0.4s runtime)  
- **Health Tests**: 1/1 passing (~0.3s runtime)
- **Total Coverage**: 21 automated tests covering user journeys

### 📝 Test Maintenance Notes

#### **Test Environment**
- Tests run against live system (localhost:8000)
- No external dependencies beyond Docker
- Automatic session cleanup between tests
- Error handling for API unavailability

#### **Adding New Tests**
